# WatchdogProject
In this project, I created a program that implements a watchdog system. The project consists of two parts; process definition and process control. The process definition part specifies the process-specific information such as process id, process name, and signals to be handled by each process. The process control part creates processes and tries to keep these processes alive so that the system continues to run smoothly.
